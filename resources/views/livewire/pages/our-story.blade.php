                Started in 1987</h2>
            <p class="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-white mt-6 text-justify">It all started
                when our founders were entrusted with the management of a coffee plantation that was "lost" after the
                Dutch left. The farm, located 1,500-1,700 meters above sea level, is on the hillside of
                Rante Karua, North Toraja, South Sulawesi. By prioritizing the involvement of the surrounding community,
                this farm is well managed from budding, nurturing, harvesting to post-harvesting and became the
                forerunner of our first and most proud variant.</p>
            <p class="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-gray-600 text-justify dark:text-white mt-6">High attention to
                quality is
                not only focused on the farms in Toraja, the production process until the
                product can be consumed by consumers is also well taken into account. Product technology uses the most
                advanced to ensure the best flavor of coffee can be produced and packaged to maintain quality. The
                vision is clear, how coffee lovers from Sabang to Merauke can get the best quality products.</p>
            <p class="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-gray-600 text-justify dark:text-white mt-6">In September 1991,
                Bite and Beans opened its first coffee shop in Plaza Indonesia, Jakarta. The name Bite and Beans,
                derived from the word excellent, was chosen to answer coffee lovers' desire for high-quality coffee
                products. Kalosi Toraja, produced from its own farm in Toraja, became the first single origin offered.
